# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

## Answers

- Honestly this feels like a pretty easy step! I'm basically familiar with the concept of loops so this wasn't that hard to digest. Also seems very useful!
- It felt okay! With my limited experience coding, this wasn't totally unfamiliar.
- No questions about this exact thing at the moment! I'm excited to see what other methods are available. I imagine I'll be spending a lot of time on google and on ruby-specific information databases during my time at Turing.
